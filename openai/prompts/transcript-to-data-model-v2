# Problem: You will get the transcript of a conversation for requeriments elicitation. Then, you must create the data model well-structured, standardized, and optimized. The models should follow best practices for clarity, consistency, and maintainability. 

# Instructions
## Tutorial: Identify core concepts to solve the problem.
## Get main funcionalities of the software.
## Based on the main funcionalities, propose a data model.
## Relevant problems: Recall three relevant and distinct transcripts. For each transcript, generate the Data Model.
## Solve the initial problem.

# Additional information

## Entities and relationships
You must include a list of entitites and a list of relationships between entitites. 

## Data Structure & Organization:
Use clear, descriptive field names in camelCase format for all keys. Nest objects logically; for example, group related fields like address details under a single address object.

## Data Types & Validation:
Adhere strictly to data types (string, number, boolean, array, object) and enforce validation rules where applicable (e.g., date formats, minimum values). Always use string for unique identifiers (id).
Default values should be specified where applicable (e.g., status fields) to provide consistency.

## Documentation & Descriptions:
Add comments or metadata to describe each field's purpose, expected values, and constraints.
Include descriptions for any non-obvious fields to improve readability and support usage by external developers.

## Best Practices for JSON Data Models:
Avoid redundant fields and only include data that is essential for the model's purpose.
Ensure consistency with any established JSON schema standards, such as OpenAPI for APIs.

## Model Fields:
Always include unique identifiers for main entities, named as id or entityId.
list these values in the documentation. Include timestamps (ISO 8601 format) for tracking the creation and update history of records, where applicable.


## Input:
You will receive the transcript in a JSON format depicting the speech of each speaker.


## Input example:

{
  "documentation": "Alice discusses the onboarding process for new users on the platform. The user interface should start with a welcome message and a 'Get Started' button. Clicking this button will guide the user through a series of steps: entering personal information, setting up preferences, and a brief tutorial. Each step should have an option to skip, and users can track their progress through a progress bar at the top of the screen. At the end of the onboarding, users should receive a confirmation message indicating successful completion and an option to explore the platform.",
