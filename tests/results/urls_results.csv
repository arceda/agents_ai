Pashmina goats are found in very high elevations of the Himalayas in India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The best pashminas however, come from the Changthang Plateau in Kashmir, where conditions are optimal for the goats to produce their super-soft undercoat.\n\nBecause of the extremely fine fiber (a mere 12-15 microns) that is used to make 100% pure pashmina products, the end result is an extraordinarily soft and luxurious product. When you feel a pure pashmina, you'll notice that it has a distinctively soft and smooth texture that is different from wool or silk products. This is because of the unique nature of the pashmina fiber itself.\n\nPure pashmina products are highly valued and prized because of their quality and the limited supply of the raw material. The process of collecting the pashmina fiber is labor intensive, and yields only a small amount per goat each season, so prices tend to remain high for the pure pashmina products. Even so, a pure pashmina shawl or scarf is a luxurious indulgence and a beautiful addition to any wardrobe.\n\nIf you're interested in high-quality pashminas, you can find more information on our pashmina collections page. You'll also find great discounts and promotions that are exclusive to PashminaOnline.com customers, so check out our promotions section today."",""role"":""assistant"",""tool_calls"":null,""function_call"":null}}],""usage"":{""completion_tokens"":383,""prompt_tokens"":36,""total_tokens"":419,""completion_tokens_details"":null,""prompt_tokens_details"":{""audio_tokens"":null,""cached_tokens"":0},""cache_creation_input_tokens"":0,""cache_read_input_tokens"":0}}"

It has rattled members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and forced the United States to again take the lead in European security. Despite Ukraine's many success in the early days on the battlefield, Putin shows no signs of relenting. The conflict has the potential to escalate into a nuclear crisis and marks the breakdown of a decades-long status quo. How did we get here? What does the war mean for the continent's future and the global geopolitical balance? What are the implications of the Western response and support for Ukraine on energy security and the reshaping of global alliances?\n\nIn this incisive analysis, international security expert Serhii Plokhy argues that we are in uncharted waters. Putin's aggression marks a radical break with the post-Cold War European order and has destroyed the delicate balance between Russia and the West that existed since the 1990s. Drawing on years of research and a deep understanding of the region's history, Plokhy explains why and how Russia's relations with the West have broken down and what happens next will affect the course of world events for years to come.\n\nAUTHOR\nSerhii Plokhy is the Mykhailo S. Hrushevs'kyi Professor of Ukrainian History and director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University. He is the author of The Gates of Europe, The Last Empire, and Chernobyl, which won the Baillie Gifford Prize and was named a Best Book of the Year by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Economist.\n\nDoes this help provide the key information from the link you shared?

As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to browse or access external websites. However, I can provide you with information about phonemes if that's what you're interested in learning about.\n\nPhonemes are the smallest units of sound that distinguish one word from another in a language. In other words, they are the basic building blocks of spoken language. Each language has its own set of phonemes, and the number of phonemes varies from language to language. For example, English has about 44 phonemes, while some languages have as few as 11 or as many as 141.\n\nPhonemes are often represented by symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is a standardized system for transcribing the sounds of spoken language. The IPA allows linguists and language learners to accurately represent the pronunciation of words in any language.\n\nUnderstanding phonemes is important for language learning, as it helps learners to distinguish between different sounds and pronounce words correctly. It is also important for speech recognition technology, as it allows computers to accurately identify and transcribe spoken language.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about phonemes or would like to learn more, feel free to ask!"",""role"":""assistant"",""tool_calls"":null,""function_call"":null}}],""usage"":{""completion_tokens"":271,""prompt_tokens"":30,""total_tokens"":301,""completion_tokens_details"":null,""prompt_tokens_details"":{""audio_tokens"":null,""cached_tokens"":0},""cache_creation_input_tokens"":0,""cache_read_input_tokens"":0}}"
